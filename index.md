## Welcome to our webpage

Here you can follow the ongoing work with our bachelor project regarding active patient response schemas for healthcare consultations. The members of the project are Kristian Andersen Hole and Jakob Halsteinslid Manne. We are both final year computer engineering students at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences where we are currently specializing in mobile and web applications. 

The project is a self produced idea that has been developed at the Digital Healthcare Lab at our university. The project will be integrated with AVANS healthcare systems. The center for rehabilitation at Haugland will contribute with testing and providing feedback regarding the functionallity of the application.

Today we went on a trip with our two bachelor supervisors to Haugland Rehabilitation centre where we had a productive meeting. We took the fery in the morning (08.00) and arrived at Askvoll some hours later where we met the CEO of Avans. After a quick drive we arrived at Haugland where we got a guided tour and ate lunch. Then followed a three hour meeting where we discussed the project and how Haugland could participate in it. We dicided that they would provide us with surveys/forms and other functionalities that they want to be included in the program. After the meeting we ate dinner and tok the fery home and arrived in Bergen in the evening (20.45). The next task for us is to schedule a meeting with the developer at Avans in order to begin developing the program.

## 03.02.17 - Initial Schetches and Startup Meeting

![alt tag](https://github.com/KaHole/group3-project-progress/blob/master/InitialScetches.jpg?raw=true)
Today we had our first meeting together where we discussed how we could develop the application. We also wrote down questions that we are going to ask our partners. The questions are regarding the technology that AVANS has used when building their patient journaling system. On the 17th of Februrary we are going to travel to Dale to visit the Haugland rehabilitation centre alongside the CEO of Avans and our local bachelor supervisor at HVL. We have decided to draw more detailed scetches that we are going to present at the meeting in order to get feedback from the other participants of the project. After this are we hopefully ready to commence initial development of the application.
