## Welcome to our project development blog

Here you can follow the ongoing work with our bachelor project regarding active patient response schemas for healthcare consultations. The members of the project are Kristian Andersen Hole and Jakob Halsteinslid Manne. We are both final year computer engineering students at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences where we are currently specializing in mobile and web applications. 

The project is a self produced idea that has been developed at the Digital Healthcare Lab at our university. The project will be integrated with AVANS healthcare systems. The center for rehabilitation at Haugland will contribute with testing and providing feedback regarding the functionallity of the application.

## 29.03.17 - Prototype

We have now developed a functioning prototype for the HS-Viewer, which is the component that are to display the schemas. Our program will now take an XML schema from the testserver and display it as a webpage schema that the user can interact with. We have added these functionalities: Short text, long text, dependant questions, radio buttons, checkboxes and dropdown and pain chart drawing. In the future we will add more functionalities. When the user has submitted his/hers response the webpage will output XML with the response that can be stored in an external storage (Avans healthcare journal) for instance. We have also worked on our pre - project report. 

Here is a link to the prototype: https://kahole.github.io/hs-viewer/



## 15.03.17 - Development progress 

In the last couple of weeks we have been developing the structure of the schemas by experimenting with different XML sctructures. We have also had several meetings with the development team at Avans as well as our superviser at HVL. We have bagan writing our pre project report that we also are going to present for our class.

The project now consists of three seperate projects that communicate with each other; HS-Designer - HS-TestServer - HS-Viewer. 
Here is a picture of how a radiobutton question is defined in XML.

## 17.02.17 - Meeting with Avans at the Haugland Rehabilitation Centre

<img src="https://github.com/KaHole/group3-project-progress/blob/master/jaobboat.jpg?raw=true" height="400" width="auto" >

Today we went on a trip with our two bachelor supervisors to Haugland Rehabilitation centre where we had a productive meeting. We took the fery in the morning (08.00) and arrived at Askvoll some hours later where we met the CEO of Avans. After a quick drive we arrived at Haugland where we got a guided tour and ate lunch. Then followed a three hour meeting where we discussed the project and how Haugland could participate in it. We dicided that they would provide us with forms and other functionalities that they want to be included in the program. After the meeting we ate dinner and tok the fery home and arrived in Bergen in the evening (20.45). The next task for us is to schedule a meeting with the developer at Avans in order to begin developing the program.

## 03.02.17 - Initial Schetches and Startup Meeting

![alt tag](https://github.com/KaHole/group3-project-progress/blob/master/InitialScetches.jpg?raw=true)
Today we had our first meeting together where we discussed how we could develop the application. We also wrote down questions that we are going to ask our partners. The questions are regarding the technology that AVANS has used when building their patient journaling system. On the 17th of Februrary we are going to travel to Dale to visit the Haugland rehabilitation centre alongside the CEO of Avans and our local bachelor supervisor at HVL. We have decided to draw more detailed scetches that we are going to present at the meeting in order to get feedback from the other participants of the project. After this are we hopefully ready to commence initial development of the application.
