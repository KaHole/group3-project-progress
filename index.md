## Welcome to our webpage

Here you can follow the ongoing work with our bachelor project regarding active patient response schemas for healthcare consultations. The members of the project are Kristian Andersen Hole and Jakob Halsteinslid Manne. We are both final year bachelor students at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences with interests regarding digital healthcare topics. 

The project is an own idea that has been developed at the Digital Healthcare Lab at our university. The work will be integrated with AVANS healthcare systems. The center for rehabilitation at Haugland will contribute with testing and providing feedback regarding the functionallity of the application.

## Day 0 - Initial Schetches and Startup Meeting

![alt tag](https://github.com/KaHole/group3-project-progress/blob/master/InitialScetches.jpg?raw=true)
Today we had our first meeting together where we discussed how we could develop the application. We also wrote down questions that we are going to ask our partners. The questions are regarding the technology that AVANS has used when building their patient journaling system. On the 17th of Februrary we are going to travel to Dale to visit the Haugland rehabilitation centre alongside the CEO of Avans and our local bachelor supervisor at HVL. We have decided to draw more detailed scetches that we are going to present at the meeting in order to get feedback from the other participants of the project. After this are we hopefully ready to commence initial development of the application.
