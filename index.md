Here you can follow the ongoing work with our bachelor project regarding active patient response schemas for healthcare consultations. The members of the project are Kristian Andersen Hole and Jakob Halsteinslid Manne. We are both final year bachelor students at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences with interests regarding digital healthcare topics. 

The project is an own idea that has been developed at the Digital Healthcare Lab at our university. The work will be integrated with AVANS healthcare systems. The center for rehabilitation at Haugland will contribute with testing and providing feedback regarding the functionallity of the application.
